### Early Life 
Luong was born in Houston, Texas, to parents of Vietnamese origin and grew up in Sugar Land. Despite living in an ethnically diverse community with a large Asian American population, he recalls that he often felt out of place and disconnected from his heritage while growing up, as others around him were mostly of other ethnic groups. He also added that he "wasn't the same as my American friends either, who would have the traditional American experience with the barbecues and all."

When he was 13, he began learning the guitar after picking it up from his grandfather. He began teaching himself the instrument while using his grandfather's Vietnamese music book. Another one of his motivations for learning guitar came from watching Drake Bell on the Nickelodeon series Drake & Josh. He cites John Mayer and Ed Sheeran as his biggest influences as a child.

He graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School and earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Texas at Austin. He then worked as an oncology nurse at the Texas Medical Center for two years.

The stage name "Keshi" comes from the childhood name that his fianc√©e's parents gave him. They have been childhood friends since fifth grade. Whenever he visited, her parents would call him "Keshi", which they still do to this day.
